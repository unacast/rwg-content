**Shifts in population and demographics in the US**

### What you can do with it

The Migration patterns dataset lets you view population movements to areas so that you can:

**Identify potential commercial hubs and areas of growth**

By observing which areas are increasing in population, especially with constituents of current prosperous areas, you can determine which areas are most likely primed for growth and make early investment decisions.

**Assess service availability by business categories**

By understanding the change in population and the available services for a given area, you can determine if demand for certain services will outstrip availability, signalling demand potential for new markets.

**Identify areas with depleting populations**

By identifying areas with great outflows, you can understand which regions are more susceptible to a depressed economy and act correspondingly to divest or increase investments as required.

**Understand regional differences in behavior**

By looking at the rate of moves for different areas in the country, you can understand the differences in behavioral responses of different population segments to nationwide events.

### How you can use it

The Migration patterns dataset helps you understand population movements by calculating:

**Origin-Destination Flows** - Extrapolated numbers of moves with origins and destinations

**Net Migration** - Inflows, outflows and net flows by area

**Income Flows** - Census-derived incomes of incoming moves

**Historical Trends** - Seasonal vs yearly trends of moves
