**Social distancing in US counties and states compared to pre-COVID-19**
### What you can do with it
The Social Distancing dataset lets you view social distancing insights at a regional level so that you can make localized decisions by answering questions such as:

- What are the differences in policy adherence within a county or city?
- Which areas are most at risk and how do I respond accordingly?
- How should I phase my reopening plan by area?
- Are certain areas getting what they need in order to stay healthy and comply?
- How will I know when itâ€™s safe to send citizens back to work?

### How to work with it
The Social Distancing dataset calculates:

**Change in Average Mobility** - Average daily distance traveled, compared to a pre-COVID-19 baseline.

**Change in Non-Essential Visits** - Foot traffic in non-essential venues, compared to a pre-COVID-19 baseline.

**Difference in Encounter Density** - Change in number of close human encounters per sq km, relative to a national pre-COVID-19 baseline.
